    "This notebook presents the core Qiskit workflow and demonstrates how to run circuits locally (simulation) and on remote IBM quantum backends.\n",

    "## Qiskit Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical quantum computing typically follows a hybrid quantum–classical workflow: we design quantum circuits on a classical machine, adapt them for the target hardware, run them (either in simulation or on real hardware), and then analyze the measurement results. The workflow used throughout this notebook is:\n",
    "1. **Map**: Translate the problem into quantum circuits and operators.\n",
    "    * Formalize the problem and express candidate solutions as circuit encodings.\n",
    "2. **Optimize**: Adapt circuits for the target hardware.\n",
    "   * Backends differ in topology and supported gates; circuits must be transformed (transpiled) to be executable on the chosen device.\n",
    "3. **Execute**: Run the circuits on a simulator or submit jobs to a quantum backend.\n",
    "4. **Post‑Process**: Convert measurement outcomes into probabilities or objective values, visualize results, and extract the best solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern underpins many quantum algorithms used in optimization and chemistry, such as QAOA and VQE, and it generalizes to other frameworks (e.g., Cirq, Q#). The rest of the notebook implements this workflow with concrete examples."

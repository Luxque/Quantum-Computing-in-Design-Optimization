    "# Single Qubit Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore qubits, the fundamental units of quantum computation, and examine how quantum gates manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bits and Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "​In classical computing, a **bit** is the fundamental unit of information, capable of existing in one of two distinct states: 0 or 1. \n",
    "By combining multiple bits, computers can represent complex data types that we encounter daily, such as text, images, audio, and video. \n",
    "In quantum computing, the analogous unit is the **qubit**, which, unlike the classical bit, can exist in a state representing 0, 1, or any quantum superposition of these states. \n",
    "This property, known as **superposition**, enables qubits to represent and process a vast amount of information simultaneously. Superposition is a fundamental attribute of quantum computing systems, allowing for the possibility of quantum parallelism. \n",
    "This parallelism is one of the key reasons quantum computers have the potential to outperform classical computers in solving certain complex problems, as we can somehow encode more information than a single bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bra-Ket Notation (Dirac's Notation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ket Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, qubits can exist in superposition states. Let’s denote a qubit by $\\psi$, and we can describe its state as $\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "The symbols with the **ket notation** $\\ket{}$ indicate vectors, meaning we can represent a qubit's state as a vector in a complex vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression, the constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are called **probability amplitudes**. \n",
    "When performing quantum measurement, we collapse the qubit into a classical bit. \n",
    "Keeping the form $\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1}$ in mind, $|\\alpha|^2$  represents the probability that qubit $\\psi$ collapses to bit 0, and $|\\beta|^2$ represents the probability that it collapses to bit 1. \n",
    "To ensure the state is valid, the equation must satisfy the normalization condition $\\sqrt{|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2} = 1$, which is directly following from the rule of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we describe the state of $\\psi$ using the classical bits, the corresponding states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ are referred to as **computational bases**. \n",
    "It logically follows that $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ must be orthogonal, which is indeed the case. \n",
    "We can represent these basis states as $\\ket{0} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\ket{1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. \n",
    "Using this representation, we can express the state $\\psi$ as follows: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\ket{\\psi} &= \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1} \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\alpha\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\beta\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\text{.}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "As we can see, the same quantum state can be represented in different forms, and these representations are expressed using linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bra Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "We could represent the state of a qubit and basis vectors using the ket notation, which denoted column vectors.\n",
    "As the title suggests, there is a notation for row vectors, called **bra notation** $\\bra{}$.\n",
    "We can obtain a row vector equivalent putting a Hermitian conjugate ($\\dagger$) on a column vector.\n",
    "Let us introduce $\\ket{\\phi} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{bmatrix}$, and to find $\\bra{\\phi}$, we can follow these steps: \n",
    "$$\n",

    "    \\bra{\\phi} &= \\ket{\\phi}^\\dagger \\\\\n",
    "    &= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{bmatrix}^\\dagger \\\\\n",

    "### Inner Product\n",
    "\n",
    "This property allows us to quickly compute the inner product of two qubit states. \n",
    "For instance, let there be qubits $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$ such that $\\psi_1 = \\alpha\\ket{0} + \\beta\\ket{1}$ and $\\psi_2 = \\gamma\\ket{0} + \\delta\\ket{1}$.\n",
